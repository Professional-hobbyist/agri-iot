# This code is for a MicroPython IoT device that reads temperature and humidity
# from a DHT11 sensor and sends the data to a FastAPI server.
# It is designed to run on any microcontroller capable of running MicroPython.
# The Arduino nano ESP32 supports micropython it is more energy efficient as
# it supports sleep mode reducing the current drawn to a few microAmps.
# The Raspberry Pi Zero has a Linus bases OS that it has to run on a 1Ghz
# single core CPU. Needless to say it consumes a lot more power and not ideal
# for battery powered devices.
# This code won't run on a regular computer.
